- **Student ID:** 8993413  

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on implementing a system to collect, process, and manage question-answer data from web sources. The system includes functionalities such as data extraction, storage, standardization, duplicate removal, bias detection, data balancing, monitoring, security, and stakeholder feedback. The repository contains the necessary scripts and database schema to achieve these objectives.

## Requirements and Features:

### 1: As a developer, creating a system where collecting data from web helps to differentiate questions from answers.
- **Priority:** High
- **Assumptions:** 
    - Extracting data can help to collect questions and answers from various sources with sorted data
    - The information collected from web prefers HTML and CSS to differentiate between questions and answers 
- **Validations:**
    - Is there any system that differentiates between questions from answers with all entries?
    - Is there any system that confirms the missed part of  question and answer ?
- **Tasks:**
    - Identify and access websites which handles sorted question-answer data.
    - Implement logic to differentiate between questions and answers based on HTML elements and CSS styles
    - Store information temporarily to ensure question and answer are differentiated correctly
    - Test and validate the information to confirm correct categorization of data
- **Actionability:**
    - This task will ensure that correct data are collected and differentiated. It is actionable with data extracting and testing tools
